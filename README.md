### Hi there 👋 My name is _Heysem_

I make 📱 mobile apps for 🤖 Android and 🍎 iOS (sometimes just for fun), I'm pretty good at designing my own 🎨 UI/UX and then converting my designs to real projects. Up to date I crafted and delivered more than 20 projects. 🚀

These are some of the projects I made and most proud 🫶 of:

- 🎒 School Planner ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazerlab.schoolplanner), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/school-planner-timetable/id1520179572?platform=iphone)) - a powerful organizer for students' school life.
- ⏰ Habit Tracker ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazer.habittracker), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-tracker-focus/id1552899398?platform=iphone)) - Change isn't easy but this app will help you get there.
- 🍅 Pomodoro ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazer.timetracker), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-tracker-pomodoro/id1615384208?platform=iphone)) - a beautiful stopwatch for organizing work hours.

I also love GitHub and its entire community 🥰, I constantly work on contributing to open-source projects. 

Checkout some of my open-source ⛄️ projects here:

- 🌟 RatingStart ([Android](https://github.com/mohakapt/ratingStar-android), [iOS](https://github.com/mohakapt/ratingStar-ios)) - an implementation of a beautiful consept (not mine) of rating view as a star shape.

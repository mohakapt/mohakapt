Greetings! 👋 My name is Heysem.

I am a proficient 📱 mobile app developer for 🤖 Android and 🍎 iOS platforms, often working on personal projects just for the joy of it. My expertise lies in designing eye-catching 🎨 UI/UX and transforming my designs into functional projects. To date, I have successfully developed and launched many awsome projects. 🚀

Here are some of the projects I have created and am particularly proud of:

- 🎒 School Planner ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazerlab.schoolplanner), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/school-planner-timetable/id1520179572?platform=iphone)) - A comprehensive organizer designed to manage students' school lives.
- 🍅 Pomodoro ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazer.timetracker), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-tracker-pomodoro/id1615384208?platform=iphone)) - An elegantly designed stopwatch to help structure work hours.
- ⏰ Habit Tracker ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swazer.habittracker), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-tracker-focus/id1552899398?platform=iphone)) - An app designed to facilitate and support personal change and growth.

As an avid supporter of the GitHub community 🥰, I am continually inspired by the rapid progress and evolution of projects when individuals collaborate. Consequently, I consistently strive to contribute to open-source projects.

Please find some of my open-source ❄️ projects below:
- 💭 [Stringz](https://github.com/mohakapt/Stringz) - A lightweight editor for localizable Xcode projects.
- 🌟 RatingStart ([Android](https://github.com/mohakapt/ratingStar-android), [iOS](https://github.com/mohakapt/ratingStar-ios)) - An implementation of an aesthetically pleasing (not my original concept) rating view in the shape of a star.
